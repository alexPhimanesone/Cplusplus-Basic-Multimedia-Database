This is a simple client server program for handling multimedia objects like photos, videos or movies. It can be used to:
1. Create a new multimedia object and insert it in the multimedia table
2. Create groups of multimedia objects
3. Delete multimedia objects or groups of multimedia objects
4. Search if a multimedia object is in the database or not
5. Display the characteristics of a multimedia object
6. Play videos or movies and display photos

There is a basic graphical interface that can be used to send requests to the server more naturally.
