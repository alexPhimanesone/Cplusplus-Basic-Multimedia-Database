# Cplusplus-Basic-Multimedia-Database

This is a simple client server program for handling multimedia objects like photos, videos or movies. It can be used to:
1. Create a new multimedia object and insert it in the multimedia table
2. Create groups of multimedia objects
3. Delete multimedia objects or groups of multimedia objects
4. Search if a multimedia object is in the database or not
5. Display the characteristics of a multimedia object
6. Play videos or movies and display photos

The next step of this project is creating a Java Swing graphical interface, to enable the user to interact with the server in a more natural manner.
